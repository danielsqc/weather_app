### Project instructions
#### Final Project (30%)  
This project is group work. Typically, a group gets the same mark for a given assignment.  

#### Project description 
Company Inc. is an IT consulting company in downtown Toronto and is looking for a team that can create a modern website for them. You are hired as the software freelance team, and your task is to deliver a website. Prototype As part of the process, you are going to create a prototype using Angular v.9 or any client-side scripting language of your choice. 


The prototype will contain the following features: 
- [5%] Show current date and time, formatted as “2020-07-28 14:01:59”. You may use Angular   DatePipe module for this feature ● [5%] Refresh your date and time display every second. You may use the standard JavaScript setInterval function for this.
- [20%] Show current Torornto, Ontario temperature measured in degrees Celsius using Open Weather Map API (See https://openweathermap.org/appid for details. Note that it may take a few hours for your key to become active).  o Utilize the Angular HttpClient module and implement this feature as an Angular Service. 
- [5%] Create menus or sections (your choice; see examples here.)  for the following items o About Us o Our Services o Our Customers Create one Angular component per menu/section. Please write a few lines of text (e.g., “This is About Us section”) as the contents of each section.
- Optional: Allow your users to see the weather only if they are authenticated with their Google accounts. Use Firebase Authentication to implement authentication 
- [5%] Deploy your Angular project to the Firebase hosting (Or any hosting of your choice) 

#### To ensure the quality of your code: 
- [20%] Create unit tests for your code. Make sure to cover at least 50% of the lines of code. 
- [15%] Run your test cases automatically for every commit using Travis CI; (you need to run your test cases with a headless browser and watch mode turned off. There are multiple tutorials on the web. Here is one example.) 
- [5%] Deploy your website to Firebase hosting automatically if your unit tests succeed.

#### Project Report 
The items described above constitute 80% of the total mark for the project. The remaining 20% will come from the project report. 


Please reflect on how some (no upper limit on the number of tools that you can cover; but the lower limit is two) of the tools (excluding GitHub, Travis CI) that we learnt in this course would be useful in developing the website. Feel free to come up with additional features for the web site which are not covered by the prototype described above. 


Essay size: 4-pages max, font = Times New Roman, font size = 12 pt.
